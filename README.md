ðŸŒ¿ ClarityAI â€“ AI-Powered Mental Wellness Companion

Tagline: "Your empathetic, adaptive companion for stress, anxiety, and mood balance."

Overview

ClarityAI is an AI-driven mental wellness platform for students and professionals. It helps manage stress, anxiety, and mood fluctuations through a sentiment-aware chatbot that adapts its tone and recommendations, offering personalized wellness activities like sound therapy, painting, and breathing exercises.

Problem Statement

Mental health support is often expensive, inaccessible, and one-size-fits-all. ClarityAI provides an affordable, intelligent, and engaging solution that dynamically tailors wellness activities to each user's emotional state.

Key Features

- Sentiment-Aware Chatbot: Detects tone (stressed, bored, anxious, positive) and adapts response style (empathetic, motivational, uplifting). Recommends the most relevant activity based on emotional context.
- Intelligent Sound Therapy: Plays adaptive soundscapes using scientifically inspired frequencies (alpha for focus, theta for calm). Can trigger automatically when stress is sensed.
- Guided Breathing Exercises: Visual inhaleâ€“exhale sessions for calming anxiety.
- Painting Relief Mode: Digital canvas for creative expression when feeling restless, bored, or emotionally blocked.
- Mood Analytics Dashboard: Tracks daily mood changes and activity engagement over time.
- Resource Library: Curated wellness content with AI-personalized suggestions (planned).
- Crisis Detection + Helplines: Detects self-harm cues and surfaces helplines (AASRA, Vandrevala Foundation).

Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js (React) + TailwindCSS
- AI/NLP: Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment; Rasa for conversational flow (planned)
- Sound: Tone.js / Web Audio API
- Animations: GSAP + Lenis for smooth scroll and reveals
- Design: Figma / Framer for UI/UX prototype
- Backend: Node.js + Express (future scope)
- Database: Firebase (Firestore) for persistence
- Auth: Firebase Auth (email/password + anonymous login)
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Cloud Run (backend, optional)

How It Works

1) User chats with ClarityAI (e.g., "I'm feeling really anxious about exams").
2) Chatbot detects negative sentiment and responds empathetically: suggests a breathing exercise.
3) App launches guided breathing + calming sounds.
4) User engages in painting or journaling.
5) Mood dashboard tracks progress and patterns over time.

  ENVIRONMENT.md
```

Setup

Frontend
- Copy environment values into your system (see ENVIRONMENT.md). Do not commit secrets.
- Install deps and run:
  - npm install
  - npm run dev

Backend (optional for now)
- Set environment variables (see ENVIRONMENT.md).
- Install deps and run:
  - npm install
  - npm run dev

Environment Variables

See ENVIRONMENT.md for all variables and notes. Avoid committing secrets.

Current Implementation Status

âœ… COMPLETED:
- Repository structure and documentation
- Next.js + Tailwind frontend with responsive design and Amaterasu-inspired landing animations
- Express backend with modular routes
- Empathetic AI chat companion (UI) with mood features
- Mood tracking with gamification integration
- Journaling UI and resources
- Crisis detection middleware with helpline integration

ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS:
- AI integration (Hugging Face + Rasa)
- Sentiment analysis via Transformers
- Firebase (Firestore) persistence

ðŸ“‹ TODO:
- Firebase Auth + Firestore configuration
- Advanced AI personalization
- Production deployment setup

Safety

- Crisis safety: App surfaces helplines when risky language is detected; see `backend/src/middleware/crisis.js` and UI banners.
- Gamification encourages positive engagement without pressure.

Why ClarityAI Stands Out

- Emotionally adaptive â€” not a static wellness checklist.
- Bridges AI + creativity + wellness in one experience.
- Designed for real-world accessibility (students, professionals).

Design Inspiration

Landing motion and aesthetic draw inspiration from Amaterasuâ€™s site for smooth, refined storytelling and subtle depth effects.
